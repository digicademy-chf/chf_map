Introduction
============

The extension allows you to build comprehensive support for maps and image
maps into your TYPO3 project. Map resources may include a few simple features
on a single map all the way to a multitude of feature collections available
in the same map with multiple available tiles users can choose from. To
produce an image map instead of a regular one, simply include an image file
in the map resource and set the projection of the feature(s) to ``Pixels``
instead of the default ``World Geodetic System (WGS 84/EPSG 4326)``. The
extension uses Leaflet to display maps on the web, which automatically
translates geographic coordinates to a Pseudo-Mercator projection (EPSG 3857).
Map resources can also be made available as GeoJSON as the extension's data
model is based on this standard. The extension is part of the Cultural
Heritage Framework (CHF), which provides additional functionality such as
glossary entries, bibliographic references, and various additional data models.

..  attention::

    The extension is not final yet. A lot of things may still change over the
    coming months.
