Introduction
============

The extension allows you to build comprehensive support for maps into your
TYPO3 project. Map resources may include a few simple features on a single map
all the way to a multitude of feature collections available in the same map
with multiple available tiles users can choose from. The extension uses the
:guilabel:`World Geodetic System (WGS 84/EPSG 4326)`. The extension uses
MapLibre to display maps on the web, which automatically translates geographic
coordinates to a Pseudo-Mercator (EPSG 3857) or a globe projection. Map
features are stored as GeoJSON. The extension is part of the Cultural Heritage
Framework (CHF), which provides additional functionality such as glossary
entries, bibliographic references, and various additional data models.

..  attention::

    The extension is not final yet. A lot of things may still change over the
    coming months.
