This TYPO3 extension implements a data model inpspired by `GeoJSON
<https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7946>`__, as part of the Cultural
Heritage Framework (CHF). All geographical features can be serialised as valid
GeoJSON. The extension also acts as a wrapper for `Leaflet
<https://leafletjs.com>`__ and provides a plugin to show individual or
groups of features as content elements in the frontend. Integrators may
further specify the map tiles or the image files they want to display as a
base map.
