  This TYPO3 extension implements a data model inpspired by
  GeoJSON. All geographical features can be serialised as
  valid GeoJSON. The extension also acts as a wrapper for
  Leaflet and provides a plugin to show individual our
  groups of features as content elements in the frontend.
  Integrators may specify the map tiles or the image file
  to display using Leaflet.
